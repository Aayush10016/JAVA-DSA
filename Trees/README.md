# 📂 Trees

Binary tree and BST problems with recursive and iterative approaches.

## Topics Covered
- Tree traversals (DFS, BFS)  
- Height, depth, diameter  
- Balanced trees  
- BST operations  
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)  
- Boundary traversal  
- Level order traversal  

## Purpose
To develop strong recursive thinking and tree traversal intuition.
